# Steps in executing

        Step 1 ) Edit the file if you want for practicing
        Step 2 ) make sure you have installed rustc in your system for compiling the program
        Step 3 ) after creating your final program, run = rustc <filename>.rs, this will compile the rust
        file into an executable file.
         Step 4 ) change the permissions of the file ( if needed ) 
         Step 5 ) Run the file ( for linux = ./<filename> ) 
# NOTE:- you'll have to run the compiled file and not the file with the .rs extension.
